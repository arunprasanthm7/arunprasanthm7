# 👋 Hi, I’m Arun Prasanth!

💻 I'm a passionate **Front-End Developer** focused on building clean, responsive, user-friendly web applications.

🔧 I work mainly with **React**, **Redux**, **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  

📦 I’m also experienced with **React Hook Form**, **Axios**, and API integrations to create dynamic, real-world applications.

🌱 Currently diving deeper into performance optimization, accessibility best practices, and advanced component architecture in React.

🚀 I enjoy turning UI/UX designs into real products and collaborating on challenging projects that solve real-world problems.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on React-based projects, frontend mentoring, or building tools that help others learn and grow.
